# This file defines the rules and workflow for the AI processing step.

# --- Your Task ---
# 1. The user will paste the full content of a note file that is in the '1_ai_cleanup' stage.
# 2. Your job is to apply the "Content Cleanup Rules" below to this text.
# 3. After processing, you must programmatically overwrite the *original file* with the cleaned-up content.
# 4. As part of the overwrite, you MUST also update the status code at the top of the file, incrementing it by one (e.g., change a status of '1' to '2').

# --- Content Cleanup Rules ---
1. Translate the text from Italian to English.
2. For technical terms where the Italian to English translation isn't obvious, keep the Italian term in brackets next to the English translation. Example: `force (forza)`.
3. Correct basic punctuation, spelling, and capitalization.
4. Remove filler words (e.g., "um", "like", "you know", "allora", "dunque").
5. Format the text into clear paragraphs.
6. If there are mathematical formulas, wrap them in `$` for inline math (e.g., `$E=mc^2$`) and `$$` for display math.
