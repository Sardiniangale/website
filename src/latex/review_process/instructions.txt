# --- Content Cleanup Rules ---
1. Translate the text from Italian to English.
2. For technical terms where the Italian to English translation isn't obvious, keep the Italian term in brackets next to the English translation. Example: `force (forza)`.
3. Correct basic punctuation, spelling, and capitalization.
4. Remove filler words (e.g., "um", "like", "you know", "allora", "dunque").
5. Format the text into clear paragraphs.
6. If there are mathematical formulas, wrap them in `$` for inline math (e.g., `$E=mc^2$`) and `$$` for display math.
