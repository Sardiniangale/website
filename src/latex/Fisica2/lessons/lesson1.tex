\section{Coulomb's Law}

Coulomb's law gives the electrostatic force between two charged particles. The force \(\vec{F}_{12}\) exerted by a charge \(q_1\) on a charge \(q_2\) is:
\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_{12} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{R^2} \hat{\vec{R}}_{12}
\end{equation}
where \(k\) is Coulomb's constant, \(R\) is the distance between the charges, and \(\hat{\vec{R}}_{12}\) is the unit vector pointing from \(q_1\) to \(q_2\). The force is reciprocal:
\begin{equation}
    \vec{F}_{12} = -\vec{F}_{21}
\end{equation}

Coulomb's constant \(k\) is:
\begin{equation}
    k = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}
\end{equation}
where \(\epsilon_0\) is the permittivity of free space.

\section{2019 Redefinition of SI Base Units}

Since 2019, the SI base units are defined by setting the numerical values of seven defining constants, including the elementary charge, \(e\). Consequently, the vacuum permittivity \(\epsilon_0\) is now a measured value with an associated uncertainty, rather than a defined constant.

For example, a comparison of the gravitational force \(F_G\) and the electric force \(F_E\):
\begin{align}
    F_G &= G \frac{m_p m_e}{R^2} \approx 10^{-47} N \\
    F_E &= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{e^2}{R^2} \approx 10^{-7} N
\end{align}
